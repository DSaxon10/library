## Editor Extension Packager
Node utilities to deconstruct and construct the config.json file.

This is useful for better editing and reviewing the code components of the config.json

### Usage

#### Unpacking an extension
- Run `node unpack.js <path_to_extension>`

The `unpack` command will take the `config.json` file and extract the `html`, `css`, `apply_js`, and `undo_js` into
  separate files for easier editing, reviewing and maintaining:

  - `extension.css`: css of the extension
  - `extension.html`: html of the extension
  - `extension_apply.js`: JavaScript for applying the extension
  - `extension_undo.js`: JavaScript for undoing the extension
  - `extension_properties.json`: Other JSON properties of the extension


#### Packing an extension
- Run `node pack.js <path_to_extension>`

The `pack` command will take the files generated by `unpack`:

  - `extension.css`: css of the extension
  - `extension.html`: html of the extension
  - `extension_apply.js`: JavaScript for applying the extension
  - `extension_undo.js`: JavaScript for undoing the extension
  - `extension_properties.json`: Other JSON properties of the extension

And save a `config.json` file that can then be provided to the Optimizely application.
